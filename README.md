# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. For now, it's pretty basic. Soon with lots of useful information and fancy animations.

## Install

Just like your usual Node project:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Quickstart

Run the hot-reloaded development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Run the production server:

```bash
$ npm start
```
